    <h1>Good Morning</h1>
    
    <p>
      One day in January you are walking around outside feeling so hopeless and wishing that you could live in a different reality. 
      You bump into someone who offers you a pill and they say it will change your whole world. 
      You donâ€™t know what that means, but you decide to take it then head home.
    </p>
    
    
    <div class="pill"> <a href="page2.html"> 
      <div class= "leftpill"> </div>
      <div class="rightpill"> </div>
      </a>
